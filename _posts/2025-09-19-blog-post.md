This is my first blog. I'm trying to use this way to study latest reseach and industrial work as much as I can. My current research interests include agentic RL. Since most of my time has been devoted to CV in the last two years, it is a challenge. But I will take it.

First, what is Agentic RL? what is agent? What is RL? What is their relationship?
